# Keynote Key Framer

The start of an amazingly cool project for cool kids only.

Will observe a keynote file and wait for someone to advance a slide When this amazing event happens it will log to file the current time since the presentation was started.

## Sample Syntax of exported file

`00:12:01 1
00:14:12 2`

## Post processing

I would like this to be a json object at some point, like:

`{1: "00:12:01", 2: "00:14:12"}`
